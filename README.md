# NESMS
A FCEUX NES emulator extension that receives SMS messages while you are playing a game, and allows the senders to manipulate the memory in real time. 

Text your Twilio number a memory address and a hex value to alter whatever game you are playing in real time. This allows you to enter cheat codes to help the player out, or even to corrupt the game's memory.
